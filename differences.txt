require() vs require_once()
-----------------------------

The require_once() statement is identical to require() except PHP will check if the file has already been included, and if so, not include (require) it again.

include() vs include_once()
--------------------------------

The include_once() statement includes and evaluates the specified file during the execution of the script. This is a behavior similar to the include() statement, with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already been included, it will not be included again. 

to avoid getting an error, it would just be safe to use include_once() instead of include() function in your php code. 
if you know you are messy with your PHP code, then its safer to use the include_once(), but if you keep track of all your code, then its ok to use the include() function.
